Madam Vice President
is the world I want to grow old in, watch children grow up in
how long had it been since I felt that optimistic? 
Not the last
Hillary matching Kamala's royal purple, like, we made it here now
I started this kernel yesterday, it's a belated Christmas gift
I said, "how much did you spend on this??"
good news is, 
not that much
</p>

<p>
You were surprised to hear my name means, "spouse-loving"
a first definition, "companion-dear" the second
I know it, but, am still so surprised by your giving
The days stretch out
while we hold quiet now
peace in less is all there is to find,
worlds build in space we make
in one room, seasons change
And I am here for you, too
