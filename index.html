First time is best 
(February)
<p>
Snowdrops popped up under the neighbor's tree, I think<br>
We can steal a few<br>
put them in our own garden out front<br>
it's not ours, it's rented<br>
but it is infront of us, nonetheless<br>
Good idea.<br>
</p>
<p>
rain comes down. "welcome to England"<br>
I have never written beside you before<br>
well, a few things unprecedented, so far<br>
for 2021<br>
to say the least.<br>

One month ago BoJo said, we are locking in, locking down,<br>
a third time<br>
and this will be a long haul<br>
It took me time, I admit, to feel it<br>
there is joy, still, in all the days<br>
and they move, now, out of time<br>
</p>
<p>
Will you let the quiet in<br>
it feels like death, so no<br>
but it's just there, waiting<br>
had I been chasing whatever dreams, i didn't even know it<br>
years and years, great band<br>
to unlearn it now, when the most important part of life has been ordered<br>
halt<br>
</p>

He said, "do you miss Canada?"<br>
I said my friends and family<br>
It is hard to be away<br>
now a weight felt by more, I suppose<br>
slowed days have made<br>
my bustling feel silly<br>
acclimatized patterns, fizzle<br>
time of day for this, that, tit for tat<br>
</p>
<p>
I wonder, where were they even born?<br>
an answer comes,<br>
"under pressure"<br>
</p>
<p>
plants grow greener<br>
I want more<br>
the world is this house,<br> 
become a jungle<br>
where we can prowl<br>
awake, dream and make<br>
into all of the day and night's hours<br>
what is real<br>
quiet grows louder<br>
and it has been here,<br> 
all along<br>
