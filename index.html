    Three days
</p>
    of snow<br>
    so rare for London<br>
    it feels cozier now inside,<br>
    you rearranged the furniture<br>
    and my parents' package finally came <br>
    big in a box, tights for me, Calvin Klein and<br> 
    for you, very fitted sweats<br> 
    thanks mom<br> 
    she always had great taste<br>
    <p>
    I find congratulation cards, all from the heart<br>
    from my family for our wedding<br>
    so happy we could be with you virtually<br>
    i could cry of happiness and the precipice of new time<br> 
    of Royal Mail in covid, 6-8 weeks<br>
    bless you, it has arrived<br>
