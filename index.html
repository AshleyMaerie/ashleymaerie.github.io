Madam Vice President<br>
is the world I want to grow old in, watch children grow up in<br>
how long had it been since I felt that optimistic?<br>
Not the last<br>
Hillary matching Kamala's royal purple, like, we made it here now<br>
I started this kernel yesterday, it's a belated Christmas gift<br>
I said, "how much did you spend on this??"<br>
good news is,<br>
not that much<br>
</p>

<p>
You were surprised to hear my name means, "spouse-loving"<br>
a first definition, "companion-dear" the second
I know it, but, am still so surprised by your giving<br>
The days stretch out<br>
while we hold quiet now<br>
peace in less is all there is to find, while<br>
jungles grow in space we make<br>
in one room, seasons change<br>
And I am for you, too<br>
